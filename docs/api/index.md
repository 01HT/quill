# API

Scribe allows you to extend its already rich functionality with a powerful set of APIs. They allow granular access to the editor contents, and notifications when they change. Check out the following pages to learn more:

- [Manipulation](/docs/api/manipulation/)
- [Events](/docs/api/events/)
- [Deltas](/docs/api/deltas/)

Several common extensions have already been built and packaged as [modules](/docs/modules/). They're great examples of Scribe's API in action.
