# Quickstart

The best way to get started is a simple demo:

{% highlight html %}
{% include quickstart.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need to do to set up a simple Scribe editor! Take a look at the [Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/editor/) docs to see what's going on here.

{% include quickstart.html %}

But the power of Scribe comes with its flexibility and extensibility. Check out the rest of the documentation to learn more.
