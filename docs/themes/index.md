# Themes

Themes allow you to provide a custom and coherent look and feel to a Scribe editor.

To use a custom theme, simply specify the theme's name at initialization:

```javascript
var editor = new Scribe('#editor', {
  theme: 'snow'
});
```

There is currently only one custom theme.

In the future we will provide more options and even allow you to create your own. We will provide documentation and guidance here once the interface is finalized.
